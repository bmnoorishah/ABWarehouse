# ABWarehouse User Guide

## Navigation Elements

### 🔍 Search Functionality
You can click on the search field and start typing the name or a keyword related to the transaction you want to find. Search results will display matching content, making it easy to locate specific warehouse operations or data.

### 📊 Reports Module
Optional module that may not be required as all the warehouse reports are covered in the **Warehouse Monitor** module. The centralized reporting system provides comprehensive analytics and operational insights.

### 🖥️ New Screen
The "New Screen" icon typically represents a command to open a new session or window, allowing users to work in multiple screens simultaneously. This enables efficient multi-tasking within the warehouse management system.

### ⬅️ Back Navigation
The Back icon is represented by a left-arrow symbol and is used to navigate back to the previous screen within the current transaction or program without exiting it. It allows users to retrace steps one screen at a time, often returning to selection screens or earlier processing screens.

### ❌ Close Session
The Close icon, usually represented by an "X" on the window frame, is used to close the current session window. When clicked, it closes only that session window but does not log off the entire system unless it is the last session open.

## System Configuration

### 🔧 Configuration Overview
System configuration is the starting point for consultants to organize, configure, and tailor the behavior of the system according to specific business requirements. It provides a structured list of configuration activities grouped by business modules.

### 🏢 Enterprise Structure Setup
Through the configuration module, consultants can:
- Define enterprise structure
- Set up organizational units (company codes, plants, storage locations)
- Adjust system parameters to match business processes
- Configure role-based access controls
